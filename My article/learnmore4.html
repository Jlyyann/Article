<b><i>The school canteen is a place where we satisfy our hunger, share laughs with friends, and take a break from the day. To make it an enjoyable space for everyone, here’s a simple, thoughtful guide to buying food and cleaning up after yourself.</i></b>  <br><br />

<b>Start by Being Patient</b>  <br><br>
If the canteen is busy, don’t rush in. Join the line and wait your turn. It’s only fair, and it keeps everything organized for everyone.  <br><br>

<b>Pick Your Favorite Meal</b> <br><br> 
Once it’s your turn, choose the food that catches your eye. Let the server know, and wait while they prepare it for you.  <br><br>

<b>Pay for Your Food</b>  <br><br>
Take your plate and head to the cashier. Be ready to pay, so the line moves smoothly, and others can get their meals faster.  <br><br>

<b>Enjoy Your Meal </b> <br><br>
Find a table that feels right—maybe with your friends or just a quiet corner to relax. Savor your food, and take a moment to recharge.  <br><br>

<b>Clean Up After Yourself</b> <br><br>
When you’re done eating, don’t just leave your mess behind. Throw away your trash in the bins provided. Take your plate to the sink and give it a quick rinse to remove leftover food. This small effort makes it easier for the dishwashers.  <br><br>

<b>Place the Plate in the Dishwashing Area</b> <br /><br>  
Finally, put your rinsed plate in the designated basin. It’s a small gesture, but it shows respect for the hardworking canteen staff and keeps things running smoothly.  <br><br>

<i>Taking care of your space in the canteen isn’t just about being neat—it’s about being part of a community that values kindness and respect. Let’s make the canteen a place everyone enjoys!</i></div>
